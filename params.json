{"name":"Split-me","tagline":"Split Me is a simple minimal WordPress theme","body":"Split Me\r\n========\r\n\r\nSplit Me is a simple minimal WordPress theme wich contains no sidebar, no slider, just a simple menu and a large area for your thumbnails. It was inspired by medium.com\r\n\r\nSplit Me uses:\r\n* Open Sans font (available through Google web Fonts: http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans), licensed under Apache License Version 2 (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\r\n* A Fontello custom pack for the icon font (http://fontello.com)\r\n* Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/) script licensed under MIT license (www.modernizr.com/license/)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw2.github.com/Manoz/split-me/master/screenshots/screen-1.png)\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw2.github.com/Manoz/split-me/master/screenshots/screen-2.png)\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw2.github.com/Manoz/split-me/master/screenshots/screen-3.png)\r\n![ScreenShot](https://raw2.github.com/Manoz/split-me/master/screenshots/screen-4.png)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nYou can see a demo here: http://splitme.mwanoz.fr/\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install the theme through the WordPress installer under \"Themes\" > \"Install themes\" by searching for it.\r\nAlternatively you can download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the \"wp-content/themes\" folder\r\nof your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n\r\nSplit Me has no options because it does not seem necessary.\r\nThe only options are those available natively in WordPress:\r\n* Custom header (the badass left picture)\r\n* Custom background (colors and images)\r\n\r\nAlso, the theme has no sidebar and the thumbnails are not displayed in a <img> tag. That's why \"Theme Check\" will not find the_post_thumbnail() because it's not needed. Read below for the thumbnails.\r\n\r\nIf you set a thumbnail on your post, it will be displayed in the large box on the left. You need to choose a thumbnail size, minimum 800x800 pixels. \r\nIf you do not set a thumbnail, the image that you have set in \"custom-header\" will be displayed.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nFor questions, comments or bug reports, please go to WordPress forums (http://wordpress.org/support/).\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n#### 1.0.0 - 20.02.2014\r\n* Initial release \\o/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
