========= Installation =========

You can install the theme through the WordPress installer under "Themes" > "Install themes" by searching for it.
Alternatively you can download the file, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the "wp-content/themes" folder
of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the theme.

========= Instructions =========

Split Me has no options because it does not seem necessary.
The only options are those available natively in WordPress:
* Custom header (the badass left picture)
* Custom background (colors and images)

Also, the theme has no sidebar and the thumbnails are not displayed in a <img> tag. That's why "Theme Check" will not find the_post_thumbnail() because it's not needed. Read below for the thumbnails.

If you set a thumbnail on your post, it will be displayed in the large box on the left. You need to choose a thumbnail size, minimum 800x800 pixels. 
If you do not set a thumbnail, the image that you have set in "custom-header" will be displayed.

========= Support =========

For questions, comments or bug reports, please go to WordPress forums (http://wordpress.org/support/).
